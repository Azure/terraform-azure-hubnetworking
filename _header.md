This module is designed to simplify the creation of multi-region hub networks in Azure. It will create a number of virtual networks and subnets, and optionally peer them together in a mesh topology with routing.

## Features

- This module will deploy `n` number of virtual networks and subnets.
Optionally, these virtual networks can be peered in a mesh topology.
- A routing address space can be specified for each hub network, this module will then create route tables for the other hub networks and associate them with the subnets.

### Routing

The module will create a route table for each hub location
